# Project Summary

In this project, you will be provided with a project skeleton for a DevMountain chat room. It will be up to you to hook up all the Angular files and build out the Angular controller and service to fetch messages from a live API. This project should provide good practice using a controller with a service that makes API calls using `$http`.
